LAGRANTO FOR ECHAM5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains all the the relevant source codes required to compile Lagranto Package. The origianl folders structure for the codes are adjusted in order to compile the 
the programs into the current directory. Note that the intallation guide for the origianl package is change here since I want to install for any linux system which is more 
easier than the original installation guide. To compile these various programs, netcdf and gfortran on bash environment is required. You would need the path to your netcdf libriary
( note that if you are using the latest netcdf, the fortran installation folder must be linked in the Makefile)

1. Export the repository containing the codes as LAGRANTO
>> export LAGRANTO="path to current directory"

2. Clean the binaries and objects if you failed to use them directory on your computer due to different system (use ldd "package" to check the compatibility)
>> make clean

3. Run make to install the package with into your current path. 
>> make

Preocessing echam model output for lagranto
------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the scripts required for post-Preocessing echam model output for lagranto. The test_extractvars.sh 
uses afterburner package to extract relevant climate variables for the raw model output. (The number of variables can be modified but U,V,OMEGA
velocity fields and surface pressure variables are required for the model). The code also uses cdo to calculate the monthly means of the variables and merge the time into
monthly output. 
Note that if all the individual variables can be merge into one file by using cdo merge

Additionally, the 6h_means also computes the hourly means for the model year runs, which can also be merge together into a single output. 

The post-processed file must be adjusted in terms of data structure and variable names using the scripts in the generate_data folder (which uses nco commands and a python script)

# Lagranto_echam
This repository contains modified lagranto trajectory model for tracking moisture sources or other related analysis with ECHAM model output. The original installation guide has been modified for easy installation of the relevant programs in a directory by just linking path of installation to netcdf libraries in the Makefile of the source code repository. The test folder contains sample scripts for running the modified package. Read the original module from  Sprenger, M. and Wernli, H.: The LAGRANTO Lagrangian analysis tool – version 2.0, Geosci. Model Dev., 8, 2569–2586, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-2569-2015, 2015 for more details.
